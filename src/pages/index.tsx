                  I've just ended an 8 year stint as a Senior Engineer at
                  Google, where I worked on making music and art and all sorts
                  of creative interactions with Machine Learning, web components
                  and web standards, and the guts of Chromium. You can read a
                  bit more about me and my past work. Most of my personal code
                  is on GitHub or on Glitch. <br /> <br /> I am available for
                  freelance work in a consulting capacity, or as a tech advisor.
                  If you would like to get in touch with me about working with
                  you, email me and we'll chat!
